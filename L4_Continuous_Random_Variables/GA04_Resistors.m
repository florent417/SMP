%% GA 04 Uncertainty in Electrical Components 
%% Resistor production
% In production of 100 ? resistors, the resistance of each resistors will be a random variable that
% is Gaussian distributed with a mean of 100 ?, and a standard deviation of ?.
% The resistors are sorted in 5% and 10% resistors. Thus all resistors within 5% of 100 ? are
% sorted in one package, and resistors between 5% and 10% are sorted in another package.
% Resistors deviating more than 10% are discarded.
